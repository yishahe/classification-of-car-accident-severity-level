# classification-of-car-accident-severity-level

Based on a nationwide car accident sata set from Febuary 2016 to December 2019, I applied machine learning models to classify severity level of accidents. Due to computation power, only data in Virginia is included to the classification problem. Original dataset can be sourced from https://smoosavi.org/datasets/us_accidents

Some codes are borrowed from ZhuochengLin, whose project can be found at https://github.com/ZhuochengLin/US_Accidents_Project
